#This pipeline describes translation of representative OTU sequences to amino acid sequences in FunGene.
#Step 1. Rename fasta file of representative OTU sequences generated at Step 19 of perox_pipeline_otu.txt. Here, we call it OTUreps.fasta
#Step 2. Open the fasta in a text editor and manually remove the long PacBio sequence names, so that OTUs are named by OTU number. Save your edited file.
#Step 3. Unalign the sequences.
degap.seqs(fasta=OTUreps.fasta)
#Step 4. Import the degapped fasta file into Geneious.
#Step 5. Manually remove OTUs that are represented by just 1 sequence in the entire data set (i.e., singletons). Consult the appropriate shared file to ID singletons.
#Step 6. Export the now singleton free list of representative OTUs as a fasta file.
#Step 7. Go to the online portal for RDP Framebot: http://fungene.cme.msu.edu/FunGenePipeline/framebot/form.spr
#Step 8. In the nucleotide sequence file box, upload the fasta file of unaligned, singleton-free representative OTU sequences.
#Step 9. In the protein target sequence file box, upload the provided file of fungal peroxidase amino acid reference sequences (trimmed_fungal_perox_amino_acid_ref_seqs_unaligned.fasta). These reference sequences guide translation of your unknown sequences.
#Step 10. Run Framebot & wait for your results file to appear.
#Step 11. RDP provides data as compressed .tgz file.  Download and unzip this file. It will unzip automatically on a Mac, but not on a PC with Windows. 
#Step 12. From the framebot results folders, find the file named all_seqs_derep_prot_corr.fasta.  These are your translated amino acid sequences.
#Step 13. Import your now translated OTU sequences into Geneious.
#Step 14. To determine if all of your translated sequences represent unique amino acid sequences, highlight all of them and prepare to perform a multiple-sequence alignment with the MAFFT plug-in for Geneious. MAFFT will give you a warning if identical sequences are present. If no such warning appears, all amino acid sequences are unique.  You do not need to actually perform the alignment.
#Step 15. Import the fungal peroxidase reference amino acid sequences.
#Step 16. Align your translated amino acid sequences with the fungal peroxidase reference amino acid sequences using the MAFFT plug-in for Geneious. Selecting "preserve original sequence order" will help to easily identify your OTUs in the resulting alignment.
#Step 17. Inspect the alignment for conserved amino acid sequences to determine peroxidase type.  
			#Step 17a. Refer to the alignment in Figure 2 of Kellner H, Luis P, Pecyna MJ, Barbi F, Kapturska D, et al. (2014) Widespread Occurrence of Expressed Fungal Secretory Peroxidases in Forest Soils. PLoS ONE 9(4): e95557. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0095557
			#Step 17b. Ten amino acids upstream from the reverse primer region (which has been trimmed off), look for the conserved D residue indicating capacity for manganese oxidation.
			#Step 17c. Eleven amino acid resdidues upstream from the conserved D, look for a conserved W. This indicates LiP-like activity.
			#Step 17d. Determine the type of peroxidase represented by each OTU as follows:
				#MnP: has conserved D, but not W
				#LiP: has conserved W, but not the D
				#VP: has both the conserved D and the conserved W
				#GP: has neither the conserved D nor the conserved W
#Step 18. Determine the percentage of sequences belonging to each peroxidase type in the data set using OTU abundances in the shared file.
#Step 19. Create a spreadsheet with the proportion of GPs, LiPs, and MnPs in each sample with GP, LiP, and MnP as column headings and samples listed in rows.  Add columns for Site (A - D in sample name) and Treatment (1 -3 in sample name indicates ambient N depositioin, 4 - 6 indicates experimental N deposition) and encode samples appropriately. Save as "peroxidase_type.txt".
